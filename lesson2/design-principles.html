            <h4>The Church of JesusChrist of latter day saints</h4>

                In this website we find the principle of alignment. 
                I like the way how the scriptures are aligned, 
                ordered and organized that helps to the observer to have a clear view 
                and read easily and not only images that are organized but as well the content.

            <h3>Proximity</h3>
            <h4>Apple</h4>
            <li><a href="https://www.applecom"></a>https://www.apple.com/</li>

                <p>
                    I considered in this page is shown the principle for Proximity 
                    since the images are related to cases for iphones not only 
                    the first images but the ones below as well, because proximity 
                    describes to the spacing and balance of images and help to illustrate 
                    the relationship among objects.

                    <p>
                        This website shows the principle of Contrast in the image 
                        for the temperature since it is emphasized with the font size and colors 
                        that compels to the observer to notice important details within the website
                        and attracts the viewer to see them.
