                     <p>
                    As a Chamber of commerce we want to be able to create a space where business can reach the comunity while breaking the barrier 
                    and ease obstacles of growth. The two personas that a chamber of commerce would target could be divided in to the following. The first persona is: 
                    Bussiness owner and entrepreneurs, the second persona would aim to target the comunity, for they are who truly move the economy and make bussinees successful.

                        <p>
                    As the first persona of target audience being business owners and entrepenours. The goeal of the Evanstown chamber of commerce 
                    is to create a group made by businees owners for business owners with the purpose of having  willingness to 
                    recive and provide support to other business, as well as promote their own while protecting their assets. Therefore, we want to be able to target big corporations
                    as well as small local mom-and-pop- business. 
                    Some scenarios samples would be : What are the requirements to open a bussinees in Evanstown?  
                    How can I become a memenr of the chamber? How can I promote my bussinees/product or services to chamber menbers?

                <h3 >PERSONA TWO</h3>
                    <p> 
                    The second target Audience is the comunity, meaning the potential customers to all the menbers of the chamber. Evanstown wants serve as the connection to being a successfull businees
                    resulting in a growing and thriving community. Since Community is our target audience the chamber will be dedicated to cominicate what the business and 
                    organizations are doing to serve the comunity. As well as organize opportunities  for members of the chamber to serve and connect with the said target audience 
                    via fundraises, comunity events etc.
                    Some scenarions samples would be: Direcory of small local bussines, will there be any local events with opportunities to shop? How do I file a complaint about
                    a business or company?
